# Stock Data
CreateStockData.py is a part of what is implemented in StockData.py

CreateStockData uses a ticker name to retrieve the stock and implement it into an excel file

StockData uses the same code and then reads the excel file to plot it in a tkinter window and provide a GUI to easily add more stocks
it also performs regression on the stock
